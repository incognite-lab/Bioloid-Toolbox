# Bioloid-Toolbox

The Matlab toolbox that allows to fully control Bioloid Premium robot.
Toolbox for communication between Robotis Bioloid, CM530 and Matlab that allows to fully control all the robot sensors and efectors. The documentation further describes the installation of firmware and the establishing of bluetooth and cable connection

## Example

 The code is in the VMC folder. The video shows the Bioloid robot equipped with the Havimo 2.0 camera looking at the computer screen. There are several objects presented (left part of the screen), robot captures these images and sent them to Matlab (upper right window shows the actual view). The unsupervised algorithm (SOM) learns to clusterize these objects and there is also motor response in the testing stage (hand in several positions) that allows to visualize error rate. The SOM is presented at the right bottom of the monitor.
